## What in the world does SBM stand for?

Single Block Mods are a style of mod first established by BuiltBroken modding [see their website](http://www.builtbroken.com/addons.html) that focuses on small mods with good content. Here's how they describe it:

    The Single Block Mod series is dedicated to creating a wide range of simple single purpose mods. 
    Focusing for most on having one block/unit of content refined to offer as many options and choices as possible. 
    This makes many of the mods in the series perfect for filling gaps in modpacks. 
    Allowing pack developers to reduce the need to include larger mods to complete a feature list. 

I do have permission to use "the brand" from DarkGuardsman himself.
